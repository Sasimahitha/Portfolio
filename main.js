                            <p>I completed a front-end web development internship at Codsoft, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React. During this internship, I collaborated with a dynamic team to design and implement responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. I successfully contributed to several projects, enhancing website performance and user experience. This hands-on experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in front-end technologies and a keen eye for detail, preparing me for future challenges in web development.</p>
